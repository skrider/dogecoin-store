# Project Summary

I built a skeleton of a shop app, but included some additional features, such as filtering, searching, and
recovering items accidentally deleted from the cart. Additionally, each item has a modal with some info about
it. Click a pricetag for a fun surprise...

## Directory
* Images are hosted on an AWS s3 bucket
* pages can be found in src/pages
* general components are in src/components, specific page-specific components in pages/*/components
* root-level files App.tsx and index.tsx are in src

## Stack
* React
* Chakra-ui
* React-router-dom
* Typescript

## Reflection
If I had more time, I would want to learn how to use Redux to handle global state. Things got pretty tangled
towards the end and I think that it could have resulted in a cleaner implementation.

It also would have been fun to actually get the live price of Dogecoin instead of a random number, but that would
have required learning a lot more.

Overall, I had a blast doing this project! Was a ton of fun and gave me a chance to improve my React skills.
